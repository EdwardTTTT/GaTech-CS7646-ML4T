ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THE INSTRUCTIONS REMAIN. If you have a grading issue, ensure you are utilizing the proper method with the Assignment Follow-Up at https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/411798/pages/assignment-follow-up-guidelines-and-process. Ensure you are fulfilling all requirements and have valid reasoning that is adequately conveyed. CODE REGRADES WILL NOT BE EVALUATED IF YOUR SUBMITTED CODE DOES NOT EXECUTE ON (TESTING) Project 6: Indicator Evaluation GRADESCOPE SECTION DUE TO GRADE SUBMISSION DEADLINE TO THE INSTITUTE, REGRADE REQUESTS MUST BE MADE BEFORE AUG 3RD, 11:59 PM AOE (AUG 4TH, 7:59 AM EST). ANY REQUEST SUBMITTED AFTER THIS WILL ONLY BE PROCESSED IF THERE IS A GRADING ERROR.  Do not create a private Ed Discussion post, Canvas comment, or an email asking for clarification, regrade, and/or other questions about the Project grade.  "Please note the following requests will be ignored: "I know my answer is wrong but is -X points fair? I think the penalty is too harsh." "I don't agree that this is wrong." "You need to check this again." -- absent a description of the error, such a request will be ignored "I know I said X, but clearly I meant Y" -- we assume you wrote what you meant and meant what you wrote "Another student had the same mistake and was not penalized." -- the fact that someone else was not penalized for a mistake does not make your submission correct Additionally, resubmitting a 2nd regrade request with an invalid argument (i.e., make sure your argument is valid before making a second request on the same penalty) is considered a violation of the regrade process. Any angry or discourteous language will not be tolerated under any circumstances and will result in the loss of your ability to submit future regrade requests.
